# Robots-vs-Dinosaurs

#1 What was the biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
    Focusing on just fundamental skeleton logic to build out the base for the program and not getting distracted with the logic. I struggled up until James and Dan both showed examples and got me to see the line of code as almost a "stepdown" file system.

#2 What was your favorite part of the project.
    The flow of how the code works finally started to click the very last day!
